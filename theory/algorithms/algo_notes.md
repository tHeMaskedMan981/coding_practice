# Algorithms 

## Sorting algorithms

### Quick Sort 
- time complexity - O(nlogn)
- 

### Heap Sort 
- arrange the given array elements in a max heap using heapify. Then remove the max element one by one and place it in the end, and keep reducing the size of the heap. 
- time complexity - O(nlogn)
- space - in-place algorithm
- Normally quick-sort and merge-sort are better in practice  

### Selection Sort
- time complexity - O(n^2)
- Auxillary space - O(1), In-place algorithm
- makes only O(n) swaps, can be useful when memory-write is a costly operation. 


## Breadth first search 
- used with graphs and trees
- a queue is used to implement bfs
- Time complexity - O(V+E)

## Depth first search 
- used with graphs and trees
- a stack is used to implement dfs
- Time complexity - O(V+E)
- Can try to convert problems to dfs which dont look like dfs in the first look






### Matching brackets problem
- Use a stack. most easy way. 
- See if 


### Use of Hash Tables 
- keep track of visited elements in a matrix 
- nth fibonacci number. to optimize, store the values already computed in hash tables. 
- memorization, caching techniques. 
- 

### Multiple variable, pointer manipulation
- traversing through a string(linked-list) from both ends. 
- longest palindromic substring in a string. traverse through the main string, at each character, spread out with 2 pointers to see if a palindrome is possible.

### reversing a linked-list 
- alt version - detecting if there is a cycle in a linked list 
- have to use 3 pointers to solve the problem. 

### Recursion
- rarely used in production
- indicator of problem-solving skills

### constructing custom data structures
- suffix tree - capture bunch of strings, 
- not everything is  about algorithms, sometimes its just basic coding. 

### Binary search 
- have to know. 

### Sliding window algorithm 
- used for mostly string type questions. 
- helps to reduce the number of iterations, and in avoiding unnecessary checks. 

## Python tips
- sorted() - sorts any iterable object and returns a list of sorted objects
