## Sorting algorithms

### Quick Sort 
- time complexity - O(nlogn)
- 

### Heap Sort 
- arrange the given array elements in a max heap using heapify. Then remove the max element one by one and place it in the end, and keep reducing the size of the heap. 
- time complexity - O(nlogn)
- space - in-place algorithm
- Normally quick-sort and merge-sort are better in practice  

### Selection Sort
- time complexity - O(n^2)
- Auxillary space - O(1), In-place algorithm
- makes only O(n) swaps, can be useful when memory-write is a costly operation. 


## Breadth first search 
- used with graphs and trees
- a queue is used to implement bfs
- Time complexity - O(V+E)

## Depth first search 
- used with graphs and trees
- a stack is used to implement dfs
- Time complexity - O(V+E)
